# Market Prediction and Portfolio Impact Analysis

## Project Overview

The **Market Prediction and Portfolio Impact Analysis** project is a tool designed to assist traders in assessing the potential impact of various market events on their portfolios. Using a combination of historical market data, real-time feeds, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models, the system predicts future market trends and visualizes how these trends will influence an investor's portfolio.

**My Contribution**: I primarily focused on the development of the market prediction input handler, real-time data integration, ML-based forecasting models, and portfolio impact visualization. Additionally, I worked on enhancing the follow-up query handling functionality, allowing traders to refine their predictions.
